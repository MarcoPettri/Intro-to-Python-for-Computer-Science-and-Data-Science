    "8. 1 ***(Check Protection)*** Although electronic deposit has become extremely popular, payroll and accounts payable applications often print checks. A serious problem is the intentional alteration of a check amount by someone who plans to cash a check fraudulently. To prevent a dollar amount from being altered, some computerized check-writing systems employ a technique called check protection. Checks designed for printing by computer typically contain a fixed number of spaces for the printed amount. Suppose a paycheck contains eight blank spaces in which the computer is supposed to print the amount of a weekly paycheck. If the amount is large, then all eight of the spaces will be filled:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "1,230.60 (check amount)\n",
    "--------\n",
    "01234567 (position number)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "On the other hand, if the amount is smaller, then several of the spaces would ordinarily be left blank. For example,\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "  399.87\n",
    "--------\n",
    "01234567 \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "contains two blank spaces. If a check is printed with blank spaces, it’s easier for someone to alter the amount. Check-writing systems often insert leading asterisks to prevent alteration and protect the amount as follows:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "**399.87\n",
    "--------\n",
    "01234567 \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script that inputs a dollar amount, then prints the amount in check-protected format in a field of 10 characters with leading asterisks if necessary"

Replace the original word in the tokenized sentence with the encrypted word. If the word is only one letter long, it will not be encrypted.

    "8. 23 ***(Project: Guess the Correct Synonym)*** In this project, you will write a guessing game where the user is given a hint, and they need to find its synonym. To start your script, you will need to create a dictionary to store both the hint (key) and the synonym (value). Add a minimum of 5 key-value pairs to the dictionary. Write a first function to select a random key-value pair from this dictionary. Do not use the popitem() method to write this function as this is absent in later python versions. Write a second function that displays the hint and allows the user to guess the different letters of the word. Each time, the user guesses a letter, the number of correctly guessed letters is displayed. If all the letters of the word are found, the user will have the possibility to guess the synonym. The appropriate output is shown on the screen depending on whether the guess was correct or not."
